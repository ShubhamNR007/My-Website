## Introduction

Building a personal website has been one of my key goals to centralize and showcase my work in cybersecurity. After months of refining my ideas, I decided to use a static site generator called [Astro](https://astro.build) to bring my vision to life.

This blog will walk you through the steps I took to create the website, the technologies I used, and some lessons learned along the way.

## Why I Built This Site

The primary reason for building my personal website was to have a centralized place for my cybersecurity research, projects, and online presence. Previously, my work was scattered across different platforms, but with this site, I wanted to bring everything together and share it with others in a neat, structured way.

Some key motivations:
- Showcase my penetration testing labs and write-ups.
- Centralize my CTF challenges and custom exploits.
- Provide easy access to my resume, cybersecurity certifications, and projects.
- Establish an online presence for professional growth and learning.

## Technologies Used

I chose [Astro](https://astro.build) as the framework for this site because it provides a simple yet powerful platform for building fast, modern websites. Here's a quick overview of the technologies and tools I used:

- **Astro**: A modern static site generator that allows me to write in multiple frameworks and supports fast loading times.
- **Markdown**: To write my blog posts, challenges, and tutorials.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling my site with a utility-first CSS framework that allows rapid design adjustments.
- **Shiki**: For code highlighting in my blog posts and CTF write-ups.
- **KaTeX**: To render mathematical formulas for my technical content.
- **Obsidian**: For organizing my notes and converting them into Markdown format.

## Design & Features

One of my main goals for this website was to create a clean and easy-to-navigate design, reflecting my personal brand as a cybersecurity professional. Here's a breakdown of the main features:

### 1. **Personal Blog**

I set up a blog section where I post write-ups on penetration testing, custom exploits, and tutorials on topics such as API security, OWASP, and network penetration testing. The posts are categorized into topics and displayed with tags for easy navigation.

### 2. **Cybersecurity Portfolio**

The site showcases my cybersecurity work and the projects I’ve worked on. This includes write-ups of my CTF challenges, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing reports. I also plan to include detailed case studies of real-world engagements I’ve been involved in.

### 3. **Custom Exploits**

A key section of the site is dedicated to the custom exploits I create for various security challenges. This serves as a repository for anyone interested in learning more about penetration testing and cybersecurity exploits.

### 4. **Integration with GitHub & Obsidian**

I integrated my GitHub repository into the site to allow visitors to access my open-source projects. I also sync my Obsidian notes with the website to share my study materials, tools, and notes related to penetration testing and security.

## Key Features & Sections

### Blog

The blog section is the heart of the site. It’s where I share my research, write-ups, and thoughts on cybersecurity trends. I organized the blog into various categories like CTF challenges, penetration testing, and AppSec.

### Portfolio

My portfolio showcases the various security projects I've worked on, including penetration tests, vulnerability assessments, and security audits. Each project has a detailed breakdown of the methodologies and findings.

### Contact & Resume

Visitors can find my contact information and download my resume directly from the website. It’s a way to make it easy for potential employers or collaborators to get in touch with me.

## Lessons Learned

### Choosing the Right Tools

While Astro is a fantastic choice for static sites, it has a learning curve if you are used to more traditional CMS systems. However, once I got the hang of it, the process of setting up and deploying content became much smoother.

### Content Organization

One of the challenges I faced was organizing all my content, especially the CTF write-ups and penetration testing reports. I decided to categorize everything based on type (e.g., challenges, reports, blog posts), which made it easier for visitors to find what they're looking for.

### Design and Performance

Tailwind CSS has been a game-changer for quickly building out the layout and styling of the site. It also helps in keeping the site lightweight, which is critical for performance.

## Conclusion

Building this website has been a rewarding experience that allowed me to showcase my skills, organize my work, and establish a professional online presence. It has also been a fantastic learning process, helping me grow in both web development and cybersecurity. 

I look forward to continuously adding content to the site, including blog posts, tutorials, and more in-depth research on cybersecurity topics. 

Stay tuned, and feel free to check out my site to see the latest updates!
